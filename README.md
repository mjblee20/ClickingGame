# Clicky-Game

[Game can be played here!](https://mjblee20.github.io/clickinggame/)

## Description
In this game you are aiming to click every single image only once! When an image is clicked for the first time, players will gain points and if they successfully clicked all images only once victory is obtained. However, if players click an image that has been clicked once before, they lose the game and new game will start

## Developer
----
### Focus

Utilize React to create websites with reusable components and take in user inputs and updating the webpage.

### Getting started

Install npx
`npm install -g npx` 

Create a React.js App
`npx create-react-app [app-name]`

### Logic

* Need two components to keep track of their states
    - Squares need to keep track of whether they've been clicked
    - Game need to keep track of the score, wins, losses, and a randomized array
